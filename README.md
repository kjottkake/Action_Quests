# Action Quests #

A simple mod that adds more action-filled, fun and straightforward quests to M&B Warband.



## Ideas for quests ##

- The Ambush Quest

You need to gather troops to ambush a band of (troops) at a certain location.
You will be rewarded with a successful ambush attempt.

- Bandit Hunt Quests

A reasonable random number of bandits of a set type, e.g. looters, forest bandits, etc., will have to be hunted down by the player for a medium reward. Simple, action-filled quest, with no chance for instant fails since any bandit on the map will do, not just a spawned party. For even more of a straight-into-the-action feeling, one or two parties of the relevant bandits could be spawned near the player and quest-giver on acceptance.



## Future Developments ##

Quests that are assigned by random villagers or characters.
If possible, traders in towns (weaponsmiths, goods traders, etc.) could give relevant rewards such as a good weapon (with modifier) or a batch of food/goods, as variation from the relation, xp and/or gold rewards so often used in base game M&B Warband.
